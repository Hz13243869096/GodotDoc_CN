Configuring an IDE
==================

We assume that you have already `cloned <https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`_
and :ref:`compiled <toc-devel-compiling>` Godot.

You can easily develop Godot with any text editor and by invoking ``scons``
on the command line, but if you want to work with an IDE (Integrated
Development Environment), here are setup instructions for some popular ones:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :name: toc-devel-configuring_an_ide

   android_studio
   clion
   kdevelop
   qt_creator
   visual_studio
   visual_studio_code
   xcode

It is possible to use other IDEs, but their setup is not documented yet.
