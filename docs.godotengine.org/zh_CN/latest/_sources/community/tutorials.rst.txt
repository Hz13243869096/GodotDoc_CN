Tutorials and resources
=======================

This is a list of third-party tutorials and resources created by the Godot community. For resources, remember that there is the official `Godot Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_ full of official and community resources too! Also, have a look at this `huge list over at Reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/an0iq5/godot_tutorials_list_of_video_and_written/>`_.

The Godot video tutorials by `GDQuest <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxboW7x0jZqFdvMdCFKTMsQ/playlists>`_, `Game from Scratch <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDEcP8Mc-7s&list=PLS9MbmO_ssyDk79j9ewONxV88fD5e_o5d>`_ and `KidsCanCode <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNaPQ5uLX5iIEHUCLmfAgKg/playlists>`_ are well-regarded in the community and often recommended as a gentle introduction to beginners.

If you're interested in Visual Scripting, `Emilio's tutorials <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9DR22-qohBDtZ74R3FxOZg>`_ may be worth a look.
