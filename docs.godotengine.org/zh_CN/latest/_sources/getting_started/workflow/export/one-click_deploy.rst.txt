One-click deploy
================

Sounds good, what is it?
------------------------

This feature will pop up automatically once a platform is properly configured
and a supported device is connected to the computer. Since things can go wrong
at many levels (platform may not be configured correctly, SDK may be incorrectly
installed, device may be improperly configured, etc.), it's good to let the user
know that it exists.

Some platforms (at the time of this writing, only Android) can detect when a USB
device is connected to the computer, and offer the user to automatically export,
install and run the project (in debug mode) on the device. This feature is
called, in industry buzzwords, "One-Click Deploy".

Steps for one-click deploy
--------------------------

#. Configure target platform.
#. Configure device (make sure it's in developer mode, likes the
   computer, USB cable is plugged, USB is recognized, etc.).
#. Connect the device...
#. And voil√†!
